Socially assistive robot, which consists of a turtlebot and a laptop mounted on it. 
The aim of this robot, is to help the patients in a home to remember certain event, 
such us taking their medication, family visits or other appointments. This prototype
consists of a scheduling program, in charge of saving and reminding the different appointments
to the users. In order to make the system more dynamic, motion was provided using costmap_2d, 
which is a ROS package that helps generate a path which avoids possible obstacles.


In order to gain a better insight of the project, go to page 40 on Fundamental Mobile Robotics. 
The file B261 is a description of how the code for the calendar was implemented.
